                    <h4>AIIJC edtech: technology of personalizing education</h4>
                    <p><span>Aim:</span> define which of the following topics <b>animals</b>, <b>literature</b>,
                    <b>music</b> and <b>sports</b> is relevant to the input text and find keywords
                    relevant to the chosen topic.</p>
                    <!-- <p><span>Process:</span><br>
                    Firstly, we scraped Wikipedia, Wordassociation, Reright pages for
                    creating keyword dictionaries for each topic. Secondly, using the
                    Wikiwordnet module we added words from topic names' synsets
                    (sets of synonyms). Then with the help of the Navec module, we
                    turned all the words of the input text into embeddings (vectors
                    where the words with similar meanings are situated at short
                    distances). After that, we found dot products of the mean vector
                    of these embeddings and each of the topic's embeddings and
                    determined the dot product with max value. Our predicted
                    topic is the one related to this dot product. Lastly, we count the
                    cosine similarity of each word of the input text embedding and
                    embedding of the predicted topic. Words with values nearest to
                    1 are our keywords.</p> -->
                    <p><span>Result:</span><br>
                    As a result, we created a PyQT5 GUI (Graphical User Interface),
                    where the user inputs text, chooses how many keywords he
                    needs and gets the topic with keywords.</p>

                    <h4>Module for Telegram-bot, which matches users by interests</h4>
                    <p><span>Aim:</span> find several people with similar interests to a user, discover
                        and try to use different ML techniques</p>
                    <!-- <p><span>Process:</span><br>
                        In the beginning, we processed json file with answers to the
                        questionnaire and made a table, where we could find out a
                        person's gender and interests by id. Then we created tables with
                        each interest's count for both genders separately and built 2
                        diagrams and 2 wordclouds representing this data. Thanks to
                        them, we could understand which interests are the most
                        common. We also tried to use ML to be able to predict gender
                        by interests but it had a very bad Roc Auc Score (0,52 it means
                        that the flip of the coin can predict gender not much worse).
                        After that, using NMF module we separated all the interests into
                        groups of 3 with similar contexts.</p> -->

                    <h4>Telegram-bot interlocutor</h4>
                    <p><span>Aim:</span> create Telegram-bot, which can give replies in Russian and English and calculate
                        math problems</p>
                    <!-- <p><span>Process:</span><br>
                        At the start, we created preprocess functions, which split the text into tokens (words),
                        and applied lemmatization or stemming (discarding word endings). Then we made
                        <b>Pushkin skill</b> based on tf-idf vectorizer (a module that counts the importance of words
                        based on their text and sentence frequency). It answers Russian messages. For English
                        messages, we created <b>Eliza skill</b>. Also, we added <b>Math skill</b> to calculate math
                        problems and <b>Deep skill</b> based on Bert model. All the skills are implemented by Bot
                        class, where we wrote the structure for Telegram-bot.</p> -->

                        measurement</p>
                    <!-- <p><span>Process:</span><br>
                        Firstly, I needed to get a YandexMaps API key. Then I created json entity with this key
                        and input place. Then using the requests library I sent the request with our json and got
                        the coordinates of this place. Then I created another json entity with coordinates and
                        chosen parameters to request a picture.</p> -->
                    <p><span>Result:</span><br>
                        As a result, I created a Tkinter GUI, where the user inputs the address, chooses scale,
                        language and unit of measurement and gets the picture.</p>
