        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Azalia Alisheva, and I was born in Kazan on 22nd of January in 2004. Currently, 
        I reside in Innopolis city, where I am pursuing my studies at Innopolis University.</p>

        <p>Academically, I am focused on Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence, and I find great 
        joy in exploring subjects such as Software Systems and Design and Data Structures and 
        Algorithms. Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in various extracurricular 
        activities that keep me both physically and mentally engaged.</p>
        
        <p>In my school days, I was an avid sports enthusiast, playing basketball and ultimate frisbee. 
        Although I no longer participate in these sports, I still enjoy staying active through 
        skiing and snowboarding in the winter, as well as running, training, and dancing year-round.
        For relaxation, I love escaping to the countryside. Whether it‚Äôs having a picnic, going to 
        the sauna, or swimming in cold water, these activities rejuvenate me and offer a peaceful 
        contrast to my busy schedule.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I am working on obtaining my driver's license. This will allow me to travel easily 
        between my university campus and my parents' house, providing both convenience and a sense of 
        independence.</p>
        
        <p>Balancing my academic pursuits with my active lifestyle is something I thrive on, and I am 
        excited about the journey ahead, both personally and professionally.</p>
